        The Killers are an American rock band formed in Las Vegas in 2001 by
        Brandon Flowers (lead vocals, keyboards, bass) and Dave Keuning (lead
        guitar, backing vocals). After going through a number of short-term bass
        players and drummers in their early days, both Mark Stoermer (bass,
        rhythm guitar, backing vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. (drums,
        percussion) joined the band in 2002.[1] The band's name is derived from
        a logo on the bass drum of a fictitious band portrayed in the music
        video for the New Order song "Crystal".
